            I am passionate about improving a students understanding and knowledge of music as a whole, always starting from whatever music the student loves, becoming comfortable with that, and then pushing into new territory, all a bit at a time. I also specialize in teaching students the basics of specific genres and use of effects/loop pedal setups.

            In my years teaching I have taught Adults who have always wanted to play, prodigiously talented youngsters, friends who all play in a band together and everyone in-between. I always tailor the lesson to what fits the student best.

            Please get in contact to organise a taster session and for rates. At the moment all lessons are streamed via Zoom.

            “Would recommend John to everyone looking to learn the guitar, his depth of knowledge and teaching is brilliant. He keeps things practical and ensures you’re working on the most valuable things whilst also being able to go deep on the technical theory concepts if you’re curious. I used to struggle with knowing if I’m working on the right things and how everything connects together but now everything is getting much clearer and I’m not doubting what I’m working on. Look forward to my lesson with John every week and always leave feeling more motivated!”
