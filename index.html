<h2>About</h2>

<di>
    <p>
        I have been a professional guitarist and teacher for 8 years, I have always had a deep interest in technology, it’s impact on performance and on our lives. I was brought up in Glasgow before moving in 2011 to study at the RNCM in Manchester, where I still live and work. 
        I still fell like I have two homes, which is lovely. I’ve learned a lot so far, which I am always happy to teach to others.
