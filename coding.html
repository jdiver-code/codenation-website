        Technology has always had a big influence on how I approach music and Art. When I was learning guitar I always loved electronic music as much as (if not more) than traditional band-based music. Recently this has lead to me developing an interest in and aptitude for CODING!

    <h3>Max Msp</h3>
    <br>
    <div>
        <p>
        Max is a visual coding envirnonment for midi, audio and visual synthesis and control. Below is a patch I made to run on an Ipad to work as the “background noise/football chant player/Alan Partridge Quote deploy-er” for the Man Utd Vs Totenham match, the second of Lockdown. (Unfortunately this is the match that the broadcasters decided to  put their own crowd noise on too..…)

    <div>
        <p>
        During my recent “Develop Coding Course” for CodeNation I learned quite a lot about python and its potential as an all round language for most applications, including simple game development. Here is  a shot of a simple Y/N decision game I helped to make with a small group. The game is called “Doomsday Party” and is set in Near future Manchester. Essentially you have to decide how to spend your last day…..
